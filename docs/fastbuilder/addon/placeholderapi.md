## Config

```yml
disable_scoreboard: false
add_papi_to_scoreboard: true
```

- `disable_scoreboard` Enabling this will make the default scoreboard not show and you can use your own or not use one at all.

- `add_papi_to_scoreboard` This will add placeholderapi support to the default scoreboard.

**If both of these are true it will not disable the defualt scoreboard**
